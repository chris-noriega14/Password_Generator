Description of Script.JS File:

This webpage is a password generator that generates a password between 8 and 128 characters in length.

When you click submit password, the user is shown a prompt that asks for how long they want their password to be.
If the response is invalid, the prompt is refreshed.

If the password length input is valid, the user gets the choice whether or not to add uppercase letters to the password.

Next, the user gets a prompt of whether or not they want to include lowercase letters to the password.

Next, the user gets a prompt of whether or not they want to include numerical values to the password.

Next, the user gets a prompt of whether or not they want to include special characters to the password.

If none of the 4 character criterias are chosen by the user, the user has to start the process of retrieving a password all over again.

If at least one of the 4 character criterias are chosen by the user, the application generates a new password using the criteria given by the user.
